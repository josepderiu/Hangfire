# Learning Background Jobs with Hangfire

This is a learning project that I'm using to improve my software development skills.

## About the Project

This project is a learning project aimed at exploring the usage of Hangfire, a framework for handling background jobs in .NET and .NET Core applications. The objective is to understand how to schedule and manage background jobs, and how they can be used to improve the performance and efficiency of an application.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a host project that is set up to use Hangfire. There are several types of jobs, including enqueued, scheduled, and typed jobs. Additionally, I have implemented a background job to handle tasks that need to be executed more frequently than Hangfire's minimum periodicity of one minute.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project, you'll need to have .NET 8.0 installed on your machine. Once you have that, you can clone this repository and run the project from Visual Studio or from the command line with `dotnet run`.

## Contributions

As this is a personal learning project, I'm not looking for contributions at this time. However, if you have any tips or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
